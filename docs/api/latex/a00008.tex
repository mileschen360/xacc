X\+A\+CC is a programming framework for extreme-\/scale, post-\/exascale accelerator architectures that integrates alongside existing conventional applications. It is a pluggable framework for programming languages developed for next-\/gen computing hardware architectures like quantum and neuromorphic computing. It lets computational scientists efficiently off-\/load classically intractable work to attached accelerators through user-\/friendly Kernel definitions. X\+A\+CC makes post-\/exascale hybrid programming approachable for domain computational scientists.
